# Reunify Documentation

## Principles

Reunify is built with the following principles in mind:

* **Simplicity** - keeping things simple, Reunify is easier to use, easier to contribute to, and more secure.
* **Performance** - Reunify is well-tested and production-ready - no modifications needed.
* **Lightweight** - Simple, modular and composable is the power of asynchronous HTTP Request/Response-Handler functions.
* **Build-In** - all important tools to create and manage Microservices are available via CLI.
* **Experience** - programmable Web-Links that responds asynchronous to HTTP requests.

Anyone is welcome to contribute to Reunify, just read [CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md) and take a look at the [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md).
